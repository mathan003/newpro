        <p> <strong>Team 7 </strong>was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake.
            Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out
            paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura
            Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following Yamato and
            Sai joining the team, the group went by Team Yamato during the former's leadership.</p>
